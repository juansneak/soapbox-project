# Soapbox Project

At SoapBox, we love Animated GIFs. So much so, we want to be able to quickly see the top gifs of the day. Weâ€™d like you to build us a page that returns the trending gifs on giphy.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with npm)
* [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/)
* [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome/)

## Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/juansneak/soapbox-project.git` this repository
* `cd soapbox-project`
* `npm install`

## Running / Development

* `ember serve`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
* Visit your tests at [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests).

## Things to improve

* Create an .env file and add the Giphy credentials there. We could use [ember-cli-dotenv](https://github.com/fivetanley/ember-cli-dotenv)
* Add a select in the Rating filter inside the FormFilter component. We could use [ember-select](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-select)
* Improve the FormFilter component so we can customize the fields. The idea is to be able to reuse the FormFilter component and add as many fields as we need.
* Add some form validations in the FormFilter component.
* Improve the NavBar component so we can pass as parameter the links we want to show in the navigation.
* Add a unit test for the serializer.
* Use nested routes.
* Use a pagination to show the trending list.
* Add a header and a footer and improve the design in general.
